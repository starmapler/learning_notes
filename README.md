# learning_notes
For my own knowledge learning. 

Maybe it's just me talking to myself. But I have to write something that can make it more professional, hmmm, perhaps? 

Maybe there are something wrong in my notes, so it's just for reference. 

I suggest you use a software called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md), of course that is just my own choice, if you find the better one please tell me immediately. 

Well, that's all, thank you for reading these nonsense, and if you see my notes, I hope that it won't waste your time.
