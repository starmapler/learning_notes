# learning_notes
For my own knowledge learning. 

Maybe there are something wrong in my notes, so it's just for reference. 

I suggest you use a software called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md), hmm, just my own choice, if you find the better one please tell me immediately. 

Well, that's all, thank you for reading these nonsense, and if you see my notes, I hope that it won't waste your time.
